Courage and Confidence. Taking a chance can be scary, but don't be afraid to take the leap of faith on a good idea. By our good idea and great efforts our RID 3000 has launched the following for the welfare of others,

We are happy that we have launched our District website RID3000.org

If you believe you can, you probably can. If you believe you won't, you most assuredly won't. Belief is the ignition switch that gets you off the launching pad. By a belief in ourself our Team Garuda is happy to launch CAREER GUIDANCE under professional development avenue. It is to assist the students for their profession.

One of the great joys of launching your idea on the web is that it's a meritocracy. The good stuff will rise to the top and find an audience yes to find our own business we have launched RLB (Rotaract Leads Business) under professional development avenue which is only for the Rotaract members.

I thank all my Team members who have worked hard for this. Kindly make use of these projects.
